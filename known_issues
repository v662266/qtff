Here is the list of known issues and their possible solutions (if any)

- No tests!
How to fix: just test it

- Weak error handling
How to fix: need more tests and refactoring

- App architecture can be better
Weak SOLID support. 

- No sound support
Only video stream is playing back (if any). Sound support is not implemented yet

- Possible memory leaks
How to fix: valgrind & inspect more carefully all allocations

- Possible improper QT use
Other better QT-specific approaches may exist. Concurrency implementation could be better

- Possible improper FFMPEG lilbrary use
Other better ffmpeg-specific approaches may exist. 

- Docker build may be far from optimal
